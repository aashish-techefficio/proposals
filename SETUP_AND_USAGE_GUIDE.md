## Step 2: Installing Dependencies
1. **Install pip (if not already installed)**:
   - `pip` is usually installed with Python. To check, run:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Use the terminal to change to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project/directory
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Step 3: Running the PKF Proposal Generator Script
1. **Locate the Script**:
   - Find the `pkf_proposal_generator.py` script in your project directory.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python pkf_proposal_generator.py
   ```

3. **Follow On-screen Instructions**:
   - The script will provide prompts or instructions on what to do next.
